# ðŸ“š Foundational Works in Generative AI

These are essential works that laid the groundwork for today's generative AI models.

- **[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)** â€” Goodfellow et al., 2014. _Pioneered adversarial training for generative models._
- **[Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)** â€” Kingma & Welling, 2013. _Introduced the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)._
- **[A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948)** â€” Karras et al., 2018. _Introduced StyleGAN for high-fidelity image generation._
